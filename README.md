## Introduction
Styling complex projects is team effort that requires collaboration between multiple designers and developers. Furthermore, many of Nectima's projects are later turned over to other development teams, which must continue or improve upon our own work. This only serves to emphasize the importance of a clean, systematic and structured approach to front-end development.

This document serves as a guide to new developers (as well as a reference to all Nectima team members) of how we choose to implement styling in front-end projects. As in life, there are always exceptions to the rule, but by following these guidelines we can make reading and writing code easier, faster and more maintainable for everyone. We want to create applications that are both beautiful to look at and painless to scale. :heart:
